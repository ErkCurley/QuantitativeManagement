```{r}

```

The objective function would be:
Maximize Z = P + -6y2p + -6y2m + -3y3p + -3y3m

Where P = x1 + x2 + x3

y2p - y2m = 6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 - 50
y3p - y3m = 8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 - 75

Thus:
Maximize Z = x1 + x2 + x3 + -6y2p + -6y2m + -3y3p + -3y3m



// Objective function
min: y1p + y1m + 6 y2p + 6 y2m + 3 y3p + 3 y3m;

// Constraints
20 x1 + 15x2 + 25x3 + y1m - y1p >= 125;
6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 + y2m - y2p = 50;
8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 + y3m - y3p >= 75;

```{r}
gp_sl <- read.lp("assignment9.lp")
gp_sl
```

```{r}
solve(gp_sl)
get.objective(gp_sl)
get.variables(gp_sl)
```

The results of this model show that y1p, y1m, y2p, y2m , y3p, y3m, and x1 are all 0. x2 and x3 are 8.333 and 3.333 respectfully. Thus the secondary goals of employee retention and next year's earnings will not be met entirely.
